There are dates from may that are higher than dates in april and dates at the end of may that are higher than those in the begging. Just from looking at the graph it seems to be telling us that covid cases are going down with time and therefore it is having less of an impact. The real story in the data is that the numbe3r of covid cases is varying with lots of fluctiation from the end of april to the first half of may. there are not mpre or less cases depending on the date.\n",

If someone saw your article and then decided to workout a lot more and then they got cancer they would get mad at you for basically lying to them about the benefits of working out.

    "3. It is a very gray area when talking about each idivuals expectations of privacy so I can see how something that one person might not care if it is hsared could be a big deal to someone else. To make sure you arent violatinf personal expectations it should be disclaimed beforehand that the info will be shared. There should be rules that unless someone explicitly agrees to their info being used and shared then it should not be used. I would want my data to be protected and not shared publicly or be able to be traced back to me. Again its very hard to turn a bunch of indivual preferencnes into a group rule that is used on when and how to share data. Yes it does matter what data you are sharing.\n",
